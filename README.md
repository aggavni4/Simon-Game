# Simon-Game
This is a basic game that uses html, css and javascipt to engage the user in this memory game.

The game starts by pressing any key on the keyboard.
A start button is provided by the program using the Math.random function of javascipt.
Then the user is allowed to press a button on the screen(supposedly the button that was given to the user by the program).
2 lists are maintained: 
1:which stores the buttons pressed by the user; 
2:which stores the buttons that are supposed to be pressed by the user(the pattern that the program gives using random number generation).
The user's pattern is matched with the pattern being given by the program on each level.
if the pattern matches, levels increase; if not game ends;

clicks are followed by animations and sound effects using javascipt audio tools and by switching the css classes on-off for animation.
